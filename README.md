# Brain-games

My game was created for the purpose of an educational project. It includes five simple games. Before each game the rules are described so I will not duplicate this information

How use these games:

- The first game "Brain-calc" launched using the command
	>make brain-calc

- The second game "Brain-even" launched using the command
	> make brain-even

- The third game "Brain-gcd" launched using the command
	>make brain-gcd

- Fourth game "Brain-progression" launched using the command
	>make brain-progression

- Fifth game "Brain-prime" launched using the command
	>make brain-prime


## Good luck
